An Improved EXISTS With UPDATE - Exercise
Exercise


Re-write the query in the "An Improved EXISTS With UPDATE - Exercise Starter Code.sql" file (you can find the file in the Resources for this section), using temp tables and UPDATE statements instead of EXISTS.

In addition to the three columns in the original query, you should also include a fourth column called "RejectedQty", which has one value for rejected quantity from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail table.
