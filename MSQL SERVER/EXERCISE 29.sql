/*
Control Flow With IF Statements - Exercise
Exercise


Modify the stored procedure you created for the stored procedures exercise (dbo.OrdersAboveThreshold) to include an additional parameter called "@OrderType" (data type INT).

If the user supplies a value of 1 to this parameter, your modified proc should return the same output as previously.

If however the user supplies a value of 2, your proc should return purchase orders instead of sales orders.

Use IF/ELSE blocks to accomplish this.
