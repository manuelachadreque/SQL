Exercise 2


Modify your "NameSearch" procedure to accept a third argument - @MatchType, with a datatype of INT -  that specifies the match type:

1 means "exact match"

2 means "begins with"

3 means "ends with"

4 means "contains"

Hint: Use a series of IF statements to build out your WHERE clause based on the @MatchType parameter, then append this to the rest of your dynamic SQL before executing.
