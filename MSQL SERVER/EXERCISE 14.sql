/*
Recursive CTEs - Exercises
Exercise 1


Use a recursive CTE to generate a list of all odd numbers between 1 and 100.

Hint: You should be able to do this with just a couple slight tweaks to the code from our first example in the video.

*/


/*
Exercise 2


Use a recursive CTE to generate a date series of all FIRST days of the month (1/1/2021, 2/1/2021, etc.)

from 1/1/2020 to 12/1/2029.

Hints:

Use the DATEADD function strategically in your recursive member.

You may also have to modify MAXRECURSION.
